For the development of this project, I will build a synthetic database simulating an e-commerce business of electronic products. The source and inspiration are coming from the following datasets:

- [Sales Product Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/knightbearr/sales-product-data)
- [Marketing: Electronic Products and Pricing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/e-product-pricing)
- [Electronic products and pricing data](https://data.world/datafiniti/electronic-products-and-pricing-data)

You can find the notebook in my Kaggle notebook:

- E-commerce of electronic products wants to expand its product portfolio, so it would like to know better its customers and their respective consumption patterns, but it has only one year of operation and does not have a large database about them, however, that does not limit us because we can take advantage of the data provided. 

**Business problem:**
- We wish to expand the product catalog offered based on the sales obtained during the last year. 

**Strategic business goal:**
- Generate a visualization and analysis tool that allows us to know our customers better.

- Give insights on customer profiles and their respective consumption patterns
    - Which products are the most purchased?
    - What are the most popular brands
    - What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
    - What City had the highest number of sales?
    - What products are most often sold together?
    - Average time of day when purchases are made
 

###Results 

Although the dataset manipulation can be done in this notebook thanks to Pandas, I decided to integrate SQL for practice, the dashboard was done in Power BI, below, you can find the script in my GitHub repository and the link to Power BI Service to see the final result
